\subsection{Budget}\label{sec:budgettab}
% The maximum amount of a Veni grant can be spent over a period of three years (see 3.2 in the call for proposals for the exact rules on the period). If the proposed research is of shorter duration, the maximum grant amount will be reduced accordingly. Additional costs may be covered by contributions ‘in-kind’ or ‘in-cash’. Please provide the total budget under 3a and state which costs are covered by other parties under 3b and 3c. See notes for all information.

% Explanation of the budget-table:
%     • Use one row each for each staff member, type of equipment, type of investment or type of material (e.g., data management costs). Additional rows (as many as you need) should be added underneath the bold print headings, listing all persons and items separately. You should not add headings.
%     • In case of contributions in kind and/or in cash, these should be listed in a transparent and identifiable manner;
%     • Years are Project Years. For example: if your intended starting date is 1 July 2023, then Year 1 ranges from 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024.
%     • The Explanatory Notes mention which costs can be covered under the Vidi scheme. Costs for infrastructure (accommodation and office automation, such as computers or laptops) are non-reimbursable. Total FTE applicant (Vidi + other tasks/projects) cannot exceed 1.0 FTE at any time during the project.

% *  	WP = Scientific staff; NWP = Non-scientific staff; please also list the nature of the post (for example PhD student or postdoc researcher)
% **	Please list the time you will spend on your Vidi, including any FTE percentage that your host institution will pay of your salary for your work on this Vidi project. If your university pays for (part of) the time you spend on your Vidi, please include this information in section 3b.
